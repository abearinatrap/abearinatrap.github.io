## Lassi and Spice
Seasonal Banana Lassi
The Lassi was good. It was a like a very big danimal which I entirely fuck with.

## Kanak Indian Cuisine
Vegetable tikka masala, plain naan, 2/5 spice
The naan was amazing, perfectly made. The Tikka masala was a bit watery and the carrot was undercooked. The service was good though. I had higher expectations, which lowers my score.
